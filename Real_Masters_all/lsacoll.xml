      <p>The College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&amp;A) commenced classes at the University of Michigan in 1841 as the Department of LS&amp;A. The faculty consisted of two professors, the Reverend George P. Williams, and the Reverend Joseph Whiting. Together they offered study in rhetoric, grammar, Latin and Greek literature and antiquities, algebra, geometry, surveying, natural science, ancient history, and Greek philosophy. Enrollment was seven; a decade later it stood at 57 and the faculty at six.</p>
      <p>University President Henry Tappan (1852-1863) endeavored to create a university based on the Prussian model, with the sciences and humanities combined in one school. Innovations undertaken by Tappan included introducing a bachelor of science degree as an alternative to the traditional bachelor of arts degree and providing the opportunity for students to elect courses during their senior year. Professorships in zoology, moral and intellectual philosophy, chemistry and logic, rhetoric, and history were added in the 1850s.</p>
      <p>The 1860s continued to see a rise in enrollment. In 1870 women enrolled in the University of Michigan for the first time. By June of 1871, 14 women had entered LS&amp;A. President James B. Angell, who served as president from 1871 to 1909, continued to refine the curriculum based on the Prussian model as originally introduced by Tappan. By the 1878/79 academic year, LS&amp;A seniors could elect half their courses. In addition Angell introduced graduation requirements based on credits: 24 courses were required to earn a bachelor of arts, and 26 were required to earn a bachelor of philosophy, bachelor of science, or a bachelor of letters. The bachelor of letters degree was introduced in 1878.</p>
      <p>Graduate work was introduced in LS&amp;A by President Tappan, under the title "university courses." Students were able to receive a masters degree or doctorate by engaging in two or three years of post graduate work and completing exams. In 1912 the graduate school at the University of Michigan was created as an administrative unit separate from LS&amp;A.</p>
      <p>An education curriculum was added to LS&amp;A in 1879, when a chair in the science and art of teaching was established. Speech and oratory were introduced to the curriculum in 1884 and LS&amp;A established the first department of speech in the United States in 1892.</p>
      <p>From 1841 to 1874 the LS&amp;A faculty elected a president to oversee the department. Henry S. Frieze was elected the first dean of LS&amp;A in 1875, a post in which he served until 1889, excluding the two years he spent as acting president of the university. Martin L. D'Ooge was the first officially appointed dean of LS&amp;A; he was elected by the faculty and his appointment was also approved by the Regents. In the very early years of the school, administrative functions were handled by the university president's office. Even after the official appointment of D'Ooge, the dean was, in effect, an assistant to the president in matters pertaining to LS&amp;A, and mostly concentrated on admissions.</p>
      <p>Richard Hudson succeeded D'Ooge as dean in 1897. Hudson was the first dean appointed by the Board of Regents without requiring faculty approval. As LS&amp;A grew, President Angell gave up his active participation in its affairs, retaining only his position as presiding officer at faculty meetings. When John O. Reed became dean in 1907 the administration of LS&amp;A rested completely with the dean. By 1921, an assistant dean was appointed to help in administrative functions.</p>
      <p>Graduation requirements were modified in 1912. These new requirements, like those of the 1878/79 academic year, pointed the way toward the present college curriculum. Students were required to take 12 credits in three different academic groupings (later known as distribution requirements) for a complete undergraduate education. For the first time, 120 credit hours were required to graduate and letter grades were established.</p>
      <p>The Department of LS&amp;A became the College of LS&amp;A on January 1, 1916. In the twentieth century, many departments that originated in the College of LS&amp;A became autonomous schools, including the School of Forestry in 1902, the School of Business Administration in 1924, and the School of Education in 1921. In 1923, the Department of Geology divided into the Geology and Geography Departments. In 1924/25, a Department of Library Science was added. A Department of Anthropology was initiated in 1928. One year later the Department of Philosophy separated into two departments, Philosophy and Psychology. The Department of Economics and Sociology also divided, and a Department of Journalism was added. Honors courses were first introduced in 1925 providing qualified students with concentrated study in English and history.</p>
      <p>Significant changes in LS&amp;A occurred during 1931 with the introduction of a program of concentrated study. The first two years of study were to focus on a liberal arts education, while the last two years were to be spent in concentrated study for the specific degree program chosen. These changes resulted in a need for academic counseling, given the continued expansion in courses and fields of study. Under the administration of the dean, the college created counseling services for underclassmen and departments took on counseling of students in their upperclass specialization.</p>
      <p>Upon the death of Dean John R. Effinger in 1933, who had served since 1912, the administration of LS&amp;A was restructured. A temporary executive committee of five faculty members was appointed to perform administrative functions. In September 1933 the regents approved a college reorganization which allowed for the dean to be assisted by an executive committee of six members appointed by the president from a panel selected by the LS&amp;A faculty. The executive committee was charged with investigating and formulating educational and instructional policies for consideration by the faculty and acting for the college in matters of budget, promotion, and appointment.</p>
      <p>During Dean Edward Kraus' tenure (1933-1945) a system of faculty evaluations proposed by the local chapter of the American Association of University Professors was adopted. The evaluations included an annual record of each faculty member's publications, student comments on the professor's teaching, and a report on each individual faculty member's professional competence by departmental committees.</p>
      <p>In 1940 LS&amp;A boasted 4,895 students and over 300 faculty members, a far cry from the original seven students and two instructors of a century earlier. LS&amp;A also taught 60% of the total educational load at the University of Michigan in 1940.</p>
      <p>With the appointment of Dean Hayward Keniston in 1945, an attempt was made to improve faculty morale, to continue to maintain an outstanding faculty, and to create higher standards for both teaching and research. An increase in faculty salaries of 20% to 25% was approved by the regents. Other matters of concern to LS&amp;A administrators were obtaining more research space and better equipment. Dean Keniston also undertook the job of accommodating the returning veterans from World War II. A committee examined curriculum revisions to meet the needs of the more mature students and consulted with experts and other academic institutions to help in planning for their enrollment. Recommendations included reorganizing the art and archaeology departments, combining the Greek and Latin departments into a classics department, and developing five year plans for each department. Administratively, two associate deans were appointed to handle problems of counseling, curriculum, and personnel.</p>
      <p>In 1948 the faculty adopted guidelines on evaluation for promotion. The three criteria adopted were teaching, scholarship, and service, especially student counseling. 1949 saw greater cooperation between departments to encourage interdisciplinary work. Department loyalty had sometimes mitigated against the success of some of the innovative interdisciplinary programs introduced after the war, including great books, linguistics, and several five year plans of study such as chemistry and civil engineering. Departments were also opened up administratively with the elimination of department heads and the introduction of chairmen, who were appointed for specified terms.</p>
      <p>During Dean Odegaard's tenure (1952-1958), enrollment increased by 34% as LS&amp;A generated 53% of the credit hours on the Ann Arbor campus. Research was fostered by integrating museums and the Institute for Social Research into the college departments that best suited their disciplines. The undergraduate library was also established, enhancing the undergraduate learning experience.</p>
      <p>In 1964 a long range planning committee was formed to study the future of the college. LS&amp;A continued to grow faster than the university at large. In 1965 a computer and communications science department was established. In 1968 the Department of Statistics was created and the Department of Library Science became a professional school separate from LS&amp;A.</p>
      <p>In the 1970s many new educational concepts were introduced to meet student demands to control their own education. The Residential College (RC), originally established in 1967, took on a larger role in LS&amp;A. The RC is a four-year degree-granting college within the College of LS&amp;A, devoted exclusively to undergraduate education. It was conceived as a small college with enrollment not to exceed 1,200 students to help combat the impersonality of a college as large as LS&amp;A. The original concept called for educational innovation and interdisciplinary studies to be taught in a mixture of small seminars, large lectures, independent study, and frequent meetings with faculty.</p>
      <p>Another innovation was the creation of a bachelor of general studies program in which students could tailor their own educational program. Undergraduate education was also enhanced by the introduction of the Course Mart curriculum, designed to overcome the rigidity of the traditional departmental curriculum by creating courses not available elsewhere in the university. Other innovations included peer counseling, more interdisciplinary courses, and mini courses offered for one credit. While some of these innovations continue to be active, Course Mart and mini-courses have slowly lost the interest of students over the years. Much of the decline in interest was attributed to greater flexibility within academic departments to offer different courses and to an increase in interdisciplinary studies. New interdisciplinary programs created included the Women's Studies Program (1973), the Program in Film and Video Studies (1975), and the American Institutes Program (1983), which later became the Program in American Culture.</p>
      <p>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s an emphasis was placed on recruitment and retention of minority students and faculty. Minority enrollment stood at ten percent in 1971, an increase over previous years. One program to increase minority enrollments was the Opportunity Program, organized in 1963 to provide scholarships and support services for disadvantaged students. The Center for Afro-American and African studies was established in 1970, in response to student demands.</p>
      <p>Two issues of concern to LS&amp;A administration in the 1970s were increasing class size caused by budget constraints and the increasing use of graduate student teaching assistants. At times up to 40% of underclass instruction was provided by teaching assistants. Freshman seminars, small courses taught by faculty members, were introduced in 1976. Unfortunately they were unable to reach a majority of new students.</p>
      <p>A major area of concern to faculty within LS&amp;A is the tension between research and teaching. Incentives have been added to improve the quality of teaching, such as university wide teaching awards.</p>
      <p>From the mid 1970s and into the 1980s the college faced budget difficulties. At times freezes were put on faculty hiring, and both long term and short term planning became critical in order to prioritize allocation of available resources. A main concern for the LS&amp;A administration was keeping pace with faculty salaries at peer institutions in order to retain and strengthen the faculty. Due to resource reallocation the Department of Geography was discontinued in 1980/81. An LS&amp;A Office of College Development was established to coordinate fundraising in 1978. Also, a greater emphasis was placed on obtaining funds through research grants. Between 1979/80 and 1983/84, sponsored research in the social and natural sciences increased 56%.</p>
      <p>Undergraduate education in LS&amp;A underwent a transformation in the early 1990s. The Undergraduate Initiative was developed and designed with the goal of improving and advancing the quality of the undergraduate experience. Class sizes were reduced, residential learning communities were developed, and introductory courses were revamped. New initiatives included Theme Semesters, which brought together faculty and students from a variety of disciplines around a significant topic, and the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), which enabled students to work with professors on original research projects.</p>
      <p>The residential learning communities became known as Michigan Learning Communities. The first ones established were the Pilot Program and the Residential College in the 1960's. However, during the 1990's additional Living-Learning Communities were developed to foster learning in the context of smaller communities within a growing university. Some of the programs included the Invention and Creativity Program in Bursley Hall, the 21st Century Program at Mary Markley Hall, the Society and Health Program in Couzens Hall, the Lloyd hall Scholars Program in Alice Lloyd Hall. Also included among the programs are the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), Science and Mathematics, Women in Science and Engineering (WISE), Gender and Leadership, Democracy and Diversity, Residential College, and the Honors Program at Mosher-Jordan Hall, Barbour-Newberry, Stockwell Hall, South and East Quadrangle.</p>
      <p>In the year 2001, the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, one of the largest liberal arts colleges in the United States, was comprised of more than 104 academic programs and six museums.</p>

      <p>The records of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&amp;A) of the University of Michigan date from 1846 with the first meeting of the literary college's faculty. They now span more than a century and a half and comprise over 500 linear feet of minutes, correspondence, memoranda, reports, and subject files detailing the activities of the college from its early beginnings in the mid-nineteenth century to its present status as the largest of the university's colleges. The records are organized into five major series: Dean's Files, 1911-1998; Faculty Meeting Minutes, 1846-1994; Executive Committee 1993-1999; Administrative Files, 1936-1989; and Reports and Reviews.</p>
      <p>Dean's files typically include budgetary materials, policy statements, administrative reports, and topical files. From approximately 1957, the dean's records include a separate subseries of departmental files, documenting the increasing complexity of the college's relationship with various LS&amp;A departments, museums, centers, and programs. In addition to Dean's files, the records in later years include an Administrative series, which holds agendas and minutes of executive, curriculum, and faculty meetings; a Reports and Reviews series which is comprised of internal and external evaluation documentation; and records from the office of the Associate Dean for Research and Facilities, which include planning for space and equipment needs during a period of rapid growth in the use of computer technology for teaching and learning.</p>
      <p>The administrative records of the college have come to the library in six major accessions beginning in 1942 with small periodic accessions thereafter. In addition, the college has periodically deposited bound record copies of the minute books of the meetings of the LS&amp;A faculty. Covering the years 1846 to the late 1990s, the minute books (oversize volumes, boxes 204 to 209, and box 388) are the most important source of information about the college, especially for the period before World War I when there are few other extant records to document the activities of the university's liberal arts college.</p>

          <p>The Dean's Files series constitutes the central file of the office covering the years 1916-2008. The organization and substantive content of the Dean's files changed over the years. In the early period a single alphabetical file covered a span of years. Later there is a separate alphabetical file for each academic year. The annual alphabetical files were later subdivided into an alphabetical Topical File and files for Departments, Centers/Programs, Museums, Laboratories/Gardens, Institutes, and Committees. The content of the Dean's files evolved over the years form being primarily routine correspondence to the central administrative record of the college. The records were received in several accession. In this finding aid, the dean's files from the various accessions have been brought together. As a result the box numbers are not always consecutive.</p>
          <p>The first accession of records (boxes 1-39), covering the years 1916-1932, the period when John R. Effinger was dean, document the role of the dean as an administrator of student problems and activities. The content of these files concerns matters of admission, transfer of credits, request for transcripts, letters of recommendation, and questions regarding degree requirements. These files, though occasionally containing information about university administrative policy, faculty affairs, and the relationship of the university with other institutions and with the public, are for the most part routine in content and of modest research value. The bulk of the records in this accession are arranged alphabetically and thus will be difficult to use when researching a subject area unless the name of a correspondent or organization associated with a subject or the approximate date when discussion of a subject within the college might have occurred is known. Fortunately, John R. Effinger maintained a separate subject file (boxes 34-37) that supplements somewhat the alphabetical files. This file contains departmental and committee files, budgetary materials, policy statements, and various administrative reports.</p>
          <p>With the death of Effinger and the appointment of Edward H. Kraus as dean of the college in 1933, the character of the dean's files changed. In this second major accession of records (boxes 40-65), dating from 1933 through the end of Kraus' deanship in 1945, the dean's files become more properly an administrative record of the dean's relationship with other university administrators and faculty members. Gone from the files are those documents and letters concerning individual student problems. The file headings in this accession are specific subjects; a much smaller part of the files are those alphabetical sequences of letters that characterized the records from Effinger's deanship. This accession of records is arranged, with but few early exceptions, alphabetically by academic year. The early sequences appear to be grouped in a random fashion: 1933-1936; 1936-1937; 1937-1940; and 1940-1942. With academic year 1942/43, the files are arranged alphabetically by single academic year. As a rule in these files, there is a miscellaneous folder (or folders) of materials for each letter of the alphabet followed by subject files.</p>
          <p>The third accession of records covers the period beginning with academic year 1944/45 and continuing through 1970/71, years when the College of LS&amp; A was administered by a number of deans (Haywa These years saw tremendous growth in the College as the University responded to returning veterans attending college of the GI Bill after World War II. Postwar files detail work with refugees, Cold War issues, including Red Scare politics, charges of un-American activities among faculty, and the massive influx of federal research funding. Files from the 1960s reflect the College responding to campus unrest, Civil Rights issues and anti-Vietnam protests. The administrative files detail the administration, budget, priorities, and the development of new programs such as the Residential College.</p>
          <p>Midway through this third accession, there is a change in the order of the files. With academic year 1957/58, the dean's office abandoned the use of the single alphabet in favor of a system that grouped certain categories of files together. At first, there were just two series of records for each academic year: the alphabetical subject files and "Departmental files." Formerly, the departmental files had been part of the subject files, but now because of their importance, the dean's office had separated them. The departmental files document the college's relationship with the various LS&amp;A departments on matters of budget and personnel. In addition to the traditional disciplines, the departmental series also includes the following folder headings:</p>
          <p>
            <list type="simple">
              <item>Botanical Gardens</item>
              <item>Communication Science Laboratory</item>
              <item>English Language Institute</item>
              <item>Language Laboratory</item>
              <item>Social Psychology Program</item>
              <item>Speech Research Laboratory</item>
            </list>
          </p>
          <p>With academic year 1958/59, the dean's office brought together in a separate series materials relating to the operation of the various university museums. Identified in the folder listing as "Museum files," this sequence of materials has been placed after the "Departmental files" and before the general alphabetical sequence. Within the heading "Museum files," the researcher will find the following headings:</p>
          <p>
            <list type="simple">
              <item>General</item>
              <item>Advisory Board</item>
              <item>Anthropology Museum</item>
              <item>Art Museum</item>

              <item>Zoology Museum</item>
            </list>
          </p>
          <p>The fourth major accession of records (boxes 201-317) covers the period of the academic years from 1971/72 to 1981/82 when Frank Rhodes and Billy Frye served as dean. The content of the files is much the same as for preceding years. One difference the researcher should note is that the finding aid lists each folder in the accession (rather than just listing an alphabetical span with an index to the subject headings used). Additionally, the dean's office, perhaps reflecting the increasing complexity and diversity of its responsibilities, created other series of records that formerly had been placed in the single alphabetical sequence. With files for departments and museums, the records for each academic year also includes files for university centers and programs, university committees, university laboratories and gardens, and university institutes over which the college had some responsibility. The researcher should note that the placement of a file heading within one of these series might vary from year to year depending upon who did the filing. A quick perusal of the finding aid for each academic year should enable the researcher to locate such folders.</p>
          <p>Issues well documented in the 1996 accession (boxes 336-355) include a proposal to create a Center for Public Affairs; information on a merger between LS&amp;A and Engineering which would create a unified division of computer science and engineering; proposal drafts for the creation of a Center for Law and Society, which would arise out of a merger between LS&amp;A and the law school; recommendations, endowment proposals, and drafts for the establishment of a Humanities Institute; and a large amount of documentation centering on the academic freedom dispute with Professor Mark Green in the early 1970s. The dispute focused upon Green's showing of an anti-war film in his Chemistry class; his actions caused an outcry among both students and faculty as this occurred during the volatile Vietnam era.</p>
          <p>As in previous accessions, the Dean’s Files received in 2000 (boxes 356-386) are primarily comprised of records for Departments, Museums, Centers/Programs, and Institutes and document the administrative functions of two deans, Peter Steiner and Edie Goldenberg. The third series, Dean's Files 1989-1998, covers the broadest period and includes more files of a topical nature, as well as Goldenberg general correspondence, committee files, and records documenting special initiatives. Of particular note within the 1988-1990 series is a run of bound documents with data on most LS&amp;A departments entitled Historical Reports. The reports contain department salary histories, comparative rankings with peer institutions, faculty teaching load statistics, position requests, and other information accumulated in the mid 1980s.</p>
          <p>Particularly strong in this accession is documentation of a dramatic transformation in undergraduate education instituted during Edie Goldenberg's tenure. Both Dean's Files and Administrative Files hold records pertaining to the Undergraduate Initiative, an undertaking that resulted in a rich array of planning documents, reports, surveys, and correspondence. Among the new initiatives documented are Theme Semesters and the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP).</p>
          <p>The Topical Files, 1997-1999 subseries, received in 2002, (boxes 389-400) contains the dean of LS&amp;A's central files related to LS&amp;A administration and budgeting, coordination with non-LS&amp;A university units, faculty awards, and other topics for the academic years 1997/98 and 1998/99. The majority of the files are from Edie Goldenberg's final academic year as dean, and the one-year tenure of her interim successor, psychology professor Patricia Gurin. Older files are included on several topics, including the Magellan Project, a multi-institution collaboration between Michigan, the Carnegie Institution, Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the University of Arizona to build two large telescopes in northern Chile.</p>
          <p>The Departments, 1990-1991 and Centers, Institutes, Museums, and Programs, 1990-1991 subseries, and the subseries of the same name for 1991-1992, contain correspondence between the dean, the associate deans, and the various academic units of LS&amp;A during the 1990/91 and 1991/92 academic years. The files include event announcements, reports, proposals and external reviews. The files also contain a wealth of information about search processes for chairs and directors of the units, hiring and retention negotiations with faculty and personnel, the development of new academic programs and initiatives, and the various priorities and concerns of the college during these years. Older files are included within the four subseries for some long-running negotiations or projects.</p>
          <p>The Dean’s Files in the 2009 accession primarily document the administrative functions of three deans: Edie Goldenberg, Patricia Gurin (Interim Dean), and Shirley Neuman. The records are divided among ten dated sub-series, covering the academic years from 1992-1993 to 2001-2002. The sub-series are then further divided into sub sub-series: Departments, Centers/Institutes/Museums/Programs, and, beginning in 1999/2000, Topical Files. The files contain correspondence between the dean, the associate deans, and the various academic units of LS&amp;A. The files include event announcements, reports, proposals, and external reviews. The files also contain a wealth of information about search processes for chairs and directors of the units, hiring and retention negotiations with faculty and personnel, the development of new academic programs and initiatives, and the various priorities and concerns of the college during these years.</p>
          <p>In addition to the dated sub-series, there are three other sub-series: Neuman, Shirley, 1999-2002; Reports and Reviews, 1973-1991; and Topical Files, 1982-1999. The Neuman, Shirley sub-series contains materials pertaining to Dean Neuman's hire and subsequent departure from LS&amp;A, personal and professional papers, and speeches written by or for the dean for specific events. The Reports and Reviews sub-series contains internal and external reviews for degree granting, non-degree granting, and smaller academic programs within LS&amp;A. However, researchers should note that similar records regularly appear in Dean's Files throughout the record group, and there is sometimes varying material for the same year in more than one location. Reviews contained here cover the period from 1973 to 1991. The Topical Files, 1982-1999 sub-series contains the dean of LS&amp;A's central files related to LS&amp;A administration and budgeting, coordination with non-LS&amp;A university units, faculty awards, and other topics for the academic years from 1982/83 to 1998/99.</p>
          <p>Some topics of interest include the Kitt Peak Telescope, a telescope in Arizona that was originally shared by the Astronomy Departments of the University of Michigan, Dartmouth, and MIT. The files on the Kitt Peak Telescope document efforts by the three institutions to include other institutions in splitting the costs of using and maintaining the telescope. Also related to the Astronomy Department are additional files on the Magellan Project, which can also be found in the 2002 accession. Other interesting topics include issues concerning the Communication Department. The first involves controversy surrounding the hire and subsequent resignation of Professor Neil Malamuth, documented in the Malamuth, Neil files, and partially documented in the News Articles (1994-95 Investigation and Reorganization) file. Along with the Malamuth controversy, there are materials regarding an evaluation of the Journalism department which can also be found in the New Articles file, and in the file Journalism Response to Faculty Advisory Committee Charge. Finally, a file from the Political Science Department, Meizlish/Brown Censorship Issue, contains documentation on a disagreement between a teaching assistant and a student regarding a passage from a class paper. The disagreement resulted in correspondence between the dean and the department, as well as between the dean and a number of newspapers that commented on the situation.</p>
          <p>The Dean's Files accession covering the years 2002-2004 includes two sub-series consisting of dean's files from 2002-2003, and 2003-2004. The files in this accession document the administrative functions of Terrence McDonald, who became interim dean in 2002 following Shirley Neuman's departure, and was then appointed Dean of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts in 2003. Scattered documents from Dean Neuman's tenure appear in some files. The files in the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 sub-series are divided into three sub sub-series: Topical Files, Departments, and Centers/Institutes/Museums/Programs.</p>
          <p>Some topics of interest include the Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum. In 2003 Associate Provost Janet Weiss headed a committee to investigate a possible alliance between Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum. This committee eventually proposed that the two units be combined. The Botanical Gardens (Matthaei) file from 2002-2003 contains correspondence and other documentation related to the proposed unification. Another interesting set of files cover the Life Sciences Institute. The new Life Sciences Institute building was completed in September 2003. The file contains documents and correspondence leading up to the building's completion. Some of the materials hint at some possible disagreements within the college regarding the building project. Finally there is a healthy amount of material included on the ADVANCE program. Beginning as a five-year, grant-funded project, the ADVANCE program continues to insure equal treatment and provide incentives for women pursuing careers in fields relating to science and mathematics.</p>
          <p>The DEAN'S FILES, 2004-2006 (2011-2012 accessions) consists of two sub-series consisting of dean's files from 2004-2005, and 2005-2006. The records continues the documentation the administration of dean Terrence McDonald. The files in the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 sub-series are divided into the following three sub sub-series: Departments, and Centers/Institutes/Museums/Programs, and Topical Files.</p>
          <p>Among the significant topics covered in this accession are the construction of the new North Quad Building, the allocation of spaces for LS&amp;A units, and the development of theme semesters, a practice that began in the 1990s.</p>

          <p>The Executive Committee series includes agenda and minutes of the executive committee meetings, along with the accompanying reports, documents, and other materials presented at the meetings for the academic years from 1968/69 to 1998/99 (with some gaps).</p>
          <p>The Executive Committee Meeting Minutes, 1999-2007, continues the series from previous accessions and contains bound meeting minutes for the academic years 1999/2000 through 2006/07. The Executive Committee Meeting Minutes appendices include complete runs of the corresponding Curriculum Committee Meeting Minutes for that academic year. In 2001/02 the title of the bound minutes was changed from "Executive Committee Minutes" to "Executive Committee Proceedings," but the same materials continued to be bound within the volumes.</p>

          <p>The Departmental Evaluating Committee series contains faculty evaluations that were completed by each departmental evaluating committee. The evaluations were used to appraise the service of each member of the faculty, no later than the second year after their appointment in the college. Areas of evaluation included teaching, scholarship, administrative service and extramural activity. The evaluations were administered by the departmental committees ca. 1949. It is unclear if the various departments administered the evaluations at the same time and whether or not all of the evaluations within each department were done at the same time. For more information on the surveys, the researcher should consult the entry for the College of Literature, Science and the Arts in the President's Reports for the years 1947/48-1949/50.</p>

          <p>With the 1966 accession An Administrative Files series has been added which encompasses records from the faculty and chairmen and director's meetings, various committees including the executive committee, budget materials and correspondence largely from the dean of LS&amp;A. All of these records are filed under Dean's Files in previous accessions. Researchers should also note that folder headings do not remain consistent in all cases among the numerous accessions.</p>

            <p>The 1942-1997 subseries of the Administrative files is comprised of curriculum meeting minutes, planning materials, and other administrative records. While the records date from 1942-1997, the bulk of the material is from the late 1980s and early 1990s. The subseries includes a long run of Curriculum Committee material (1948-1994). Reports and surveys prepared by the Planning Committee on the Undergraduate Experience include "A Michigan Education," "The Challenges of Undergraduate Education at the University of Michigan," a department by department survey, and responses to various reports. A file entitled "Memorials" holds profiles for deceased faculty dating from 1942 to 1966. In addition, there are several folders of Edie Goldenberg speeches, presentations, and faculty meeting remarks.</p>

          <p>The Associate Dean for Research and Facilities files were mainly generated from John Jonides' tenure as associate dean, although there are a few records from the office of his predecessor, Richard Ford. Functions of the office during this period included monitoring of research budgets and negotiation of cost-sharing; supervision of collegiate activities in computing, microcomputer acquisition and allocation of MTS (Michigan Terminal System) funds; management of budget for facilities construction, renovation and equipment; and analysis of research policy and administration. Each of these functions are documented in the records. Of particular note to researchers interested in the evolution of computing within LS&amp;A are interactions with ITD (Information Technology Division). During this period, both units were heavily involved in responding to rapidly changing technology in higher education.</p>

          <p>Reports and Reviews, new as a series in the 2000 accession, is particularly important. Internal and external reviews for degree granting, non-degree granting, and smaller academic programs are regularly scheduled within LS&amp;A, and this series is wholly comprised of data and documentation relating to the review process. However, researchers should note that similar records regularly appear in Dean's Files throughout the record group, and there is sometimes varying material for the same year in more than one location. Reviews contained here cover the period 1972 to 1996. Also included in this series are several budget reports, including detailed Executive Committee Red Books for 1992-1995, that contain department summaries, actual expenditures and transfers, and department profiles.</p>

          <p>The Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education files were primarily generated during the tenure of four associate deans: Jack Meiland, Michael M. Martin, Robert M. Owen, and Lincoln B. Faller. Although some of the records date back to 1954, the bulk of the records are from 1989-2001. The office of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education was not established until 1990/91, but many of the functions of the office were carried out through other offices in LS&amp;A until that time. Several of the functions were handled through the office of the Associate Dean for Long Range Planning, which was held by Jack Meiland until he was appointed Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education. As such, these files contain evidence of long-range planning carried over.</p>
          <p>The files are made up of four sub-series: Curriculum Committee Minutes, 1979-2000; Curriculum Files, 1954-1999; General Files, 1992-2001; Martin, Michael, 1989-1994; and Joint Faculty-Student Policy Committee, 1991-2000. Files for the 2009 addition to this series are arranged within the first four sub-series. One of the functions of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education was to act as chair for the Curriculum Committee. The Curriculum Files are made up of alphabetically arranged files containing background information and other materials related to the Curriculum Committee Minutes, as well as a run of Deleted Course Approval Request Forms (CARF's) that are arranged alphabetically by department/program. The General Files are made up of files documenting the other functions of the Associate Dean's office. These files include center, department, and program files similar to the files found in the Dean's Files series, as well as a run of alphabetically arranged topical files. The Martin, Michael sub-series contains documentation related to Michael Martin's tenure as Associate Dean, with some materials from Jack Meiland's tenure, presumably because their terms overlap (Meiland served as Associate Dean from 1990-1992; Martin served from 1991-1995).</p>
          <p>Strong topics in these files include diversity in the undergraduate community. Files on the Alliance for Minority Participation, and on University Course 299, a seminar focused on issues revolving around race and ethnicity, are particularly good sources on how the College of LS&amp;A was promoting diversity on campus. Another interesting set of files, related to the issue of diversity, document the course English 317: How to Be Gay. The course incited a large amount of controversy as a result of the course title and description, and the file contains a wealth of correspondence from Michigan citizens commenting on the University's decision to offer the course. Also well documented is the continued emphasis on improving undergraduate education, as began during Edie Goldenberg's tenure as Dean. The files on First Year Seminars and Living-Learning Communities contain a large amount of material on efforts to improve the educational experience for undergraduates, especially those in their first and second year. Other well-documented topics include Advising, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the Undergraduate Admissions Advisory Committee.</p>

          <p>The College of LS&amp;A Archived Website series documents the academic programs, accomplishments, resources, events, and people at the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.

The website series is arranged chronologically, with captures from 2002 and 2003 stored on CD. Starting in 2010, this archived website will be captured on a regular, ongoing basis as part of the University of Michigan Web Archives, hosted at http://webarchives.cdlib.org/a/universityofmichigan/.</p>
