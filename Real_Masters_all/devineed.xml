    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Edmond Francis DeVine was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan on August 9, 1916. He attended St. Thomas High where he was a member of the track, football, and basketball teams. DeVine received his bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1937, where he lettered in track as a half-miler and was a member of Phi Kappa Psi. He graduated from the University of Michigan Laws School in 1940. DeVine was an editor of the Michigan Law Review and a member of the Phi Delta Phi legal fraternity. He attended Catholic University of America on a fellowship, and received his Master of Laws (LLM) degree in 1941. In 1941, he was appointed a special agent of the FBI, and was assigned to offices in El Paso, San Diego, and San Francisco. In 1943, DeVine was commissioned as an Ensign in the Navy. He served as an Air Combat Intelligence Officer with VF29, a Fighter Squadron that flew Hellcats from aircraft carrier USS Cabot with the First Carrier Task Force in the Pacific. With his Air Group, he received the Presidential Unit Citation and four battle stars, reflecting actions off the Philippines, Formosa, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. DeVine was awarded the Bronze Star "with combat V, for valor." In 1949, he was appointed Chief Assistant Prosecuting Attorney of Washtenaw County. DeVine was elected Washtenaw County Prosecutor in 1951 and served two additional terms. He served as president of the Michigan Prosecuting Attorney's Association and Director of the National Association of District Attorneys. He taught Criminal Law and trial practice at the University of Michigan Law School as a lecturer, then Adjunct Professor, from 1949 to 1979. In 1955, DeVine married Elizabeth (Libby) Palmer Ward of Pontiac, Michigan. Devine was a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers and the Michigan State Bar Foundation and a Commissioner of the State Bar of Michigan. He was a member of the varsity "M" Club. At the age of 73, DeVine started a new career of competitive running. In 2007, USA Track &amp; Field Association presented him with the Paul Spangler Award given to "the outstanding master's long distance running athlete [in the nation] in the oldest age category." DeVine passed away at his home on February 15, 2012.</p>
